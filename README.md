# fantasy_football_projections

## Background
This repository houses various tools I have created to aid me during the fantasy football season. I am currently in a [Sleeper league](https://www.sleeper.app), so development is focused there.

## Details
This repository is all in Python 3.6.9. It is formatted using [black](https://github.com/psf/black) and run using [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv).

## Ideas/Scratchwork
- Change names of 'data' and 'projections' attributes and 'get_data' and 'convert_projections' methods to better reflect what they are meant to do
- What to do in the case of name collision across positions? If two players have same name, then only the last one will be presented in the converted projections
- Update folder structure for project
