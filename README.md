# fantasy_football_projections

## Ideas/Scratchwork
- Change names of 'data' and 'projections' attributes and 'get_data' and 'convert_projections' methods to better reflect what they are meant to do
- What to do in the case of name collision across positions? If two players have same name, then only the last one will be presented in the converted projections
